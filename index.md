# Welcome to my blog

_Obigatory First Post_

Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my first blog post
on github. I hope to use this blog as a journal of my learning experience 
as I try to go back to school and complete my degree and begin a career 
as a Front End developer.  Here's a few reasons I chose github as a 
resource to supplement my learning in school:

1. Github is not just a website, or a product.  It is a community.  I
made some mistakes my first attempt at college.  And not integrating
myself into a community was probably my biggest one.
2. I want to document my learning experience so I can refer back to
these lessons later on in life. As, I've gotten older, I've realized
I need to write something down in my own words to ensure I have really
learned a concept. So, why not write it down forever?
3. I hope that in sharing my learning experience I can help someone
else in their learning experience. Learning is better done in community.
Let's do this together.
