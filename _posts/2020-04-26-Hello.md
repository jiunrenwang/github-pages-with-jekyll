**Hello**

Hello,

I like to take a moment and share a bit of my origin story with you.
Last year I took a leap of faith and decided to go back to school. It
was the first time I've stepped into a classroom since... 

_checks sundial and stone tablets_

... **2004**

Definitely one of the scariest things I've ever done. But, thankfully,
I have a wonderful wife and family that cheered me on and didn't let
me quit on myself.
